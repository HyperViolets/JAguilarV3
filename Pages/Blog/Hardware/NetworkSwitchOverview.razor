    <p class="generalText">
        A network switch is used to connect multiple devices together to form a network. Commonly, they are composed of multiple Ethernet ports. Switches are the successor to the now obsolete network hubs. Hubs don’t know which device is connected to which port. To make sure the receiving device gets it’s data, the hub would send the data to all devices connected to it. This method is resource wasteful because most packets get dropped and it introduces security concerns. Switches, on the other hand, have MAC tables to tell which device is plugged into each port. This way data can be sent directly to each device.
    </p>

    <h4 class="articleTitle">Layers</h4>
    <p class="generalText">
        Layer 2 switches operate on the second layer of the OSI model. To send data to the right device, L2 switches use MAC addresses. The MAC address of each device connected to the switch is stored in the switch’s MAC table.
    </p>
    <p class="generalText">
        Layer 3 switches were first designed to improve the performance on large networks. To send data to other networks, a router is typically used. L3 switches are composed of a switch and router. This removes the extra layer of having a separate route. However, it doesn’t have the full functionality of a separate router like a WAN port. They can do everything a L2 switch does plus work on layer 3. Layer 3 of the OSI model deals with IP addresses. L2 switches become slow under a high amount of traffic. L3 switches integrates a router through the hardware level instead of software. Usually, router logic is software. L3 switches uses integrated circuits for router logic to increase performance. VLAN performance is increased through a L3 switch. One of the major downsides to L3 switches is the cost. You can save money by having a L3 core switch with L2 switches connected to it.
    </p>

    <h4 class="articleTitle">Console Port</h4>
    <p class="generalText">
        Switch configuration can be done through the console port. The console port is an RJ45 port that carries a serial connection instead of Ethernet. The switch will come with an RJ45 to DB9 adapter. You plug the in the cable and connect the DB9 part to your laptop. These days, laptops don’t have a DB9 port. You can get a DB9 to USB adapter to connect the console cable to your laptop. This adapter does need a driver to work. Drivers can be found on the manufacturer’s website. Newer switches may also include a mini/micro USB console port. This can be used instead of the RJ45 console port. All these cables are likely proprietary cables.

    <p class="generalText">
        On Windows, the most common way to connect to a console port is with Putty. Within Putty, go to the serial connection option and put in the right COM port. If you don’t know the COM port then look at Windows devices and find the COM port listed. Things are a bit more complicated on Mac and Linux so look up a tutorial on how to do it.
    </p>

    <h4 class="articleTitle">AUX Port</h4>
    <p class="generalText">
        The Auxiliary port is a backup port for the console port. You can use it instead of the console port. However, it’s not quite simple to do it. To use the AUX port you need to connect a rollover cable to the serial port of a modem or router. You access the switch through the modem/router. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="articleTitle">Ethernet Management Port</h4>
    <p class="generalText">
        Another common port is the Ethernet Management port. The Management port is another alternative port that can be used instead of the console port for switch configuration. The difference is that the Management port operates on layer 3. It’s a console port, but with an IP address. Don’t confuse this with the management IP of the switch.
    </p>

    <h4 class="articleTitle">SFP</h4>
    <p class="generalText">
        Some switches have slots to input modules such as SFP (Small Form-factor Pluggable). They are hot-pluggable network modules. These modules support SONET, Ethernet, Fibre and other protocols. They add modification options to switches. SFP+ is an enhanced version of SFP that supports higher speeds.
    </p>
    <p class="generalText">
        SFP replaces the much larger module GBIC (gigabit interface converter). Due to this, SFP is sometimes labeled as mini GBIC.

    <h4 class="articleTitle">Switch LED</h4>
    <p class="generalText">
        LEDs on a switch contains a lot of info of the current state of the switch. The table below shows common LEDs you can find on a switch. Look at your switch manual for the specific details. 
    </p>

    <h4 class="articleTitle">Rapid Fire Info</h4>
    <p class="generalText">
        A Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is used to segment the network. A VLAN can be access or trunk mode. Access mode supports only one VLAN. Trunk mode supports multiple VLANs. Each port on a switch can be configured to be on a different VLAN.
    </p>
    <p class="generalText">
        The main reason switches are so load is due to the fan size. Switches are usually 1U in size which means that the fans to cool the switch can’t be too big. A smaller fan needs to spin faster to move the same amount of air as a larger fan. The high speed of fan spinning causes a lot of noise. Also, a switch has multiple small fans to keep it cool.
    </p>
    <p class="generalText">
        The Ethernet and SFP ports on a switch can be dual-personality ports. You can use the Ethernet or SFP port, but not both at the same time.
    </p>
    <p class="generalText">
        Switches can be put into stacking mode. Stacking is referring to connecting two or more switches together to act as a single switch. You need a stacking module to stack switches.
    </p>
    <p class="generalText">
        The USB type A port on a switch is used to upgrade the firmware of the switch.
    </p>
    <p class="generalText">
        An unmanaged switch doesn’t need any configuration. This way unmanaged switches can be plug & play. Managed switches need to be configured. Configuration such as turning ports on or off, adding VLANs and etc.
    </p>
    <p class="generalText">
        Switches are designed to use power supply modules that slot into the case of a switch. This way when the power supply fails you can easily remove and replace it. When you first get a new switch you have to slot the power supplies into place. They can take more than one power supply for redundancy.
