    <h4 class="articleTitle">WAN</h4>
    <p class="generalText">
        A wide area network (WAN) is where computers are connected together across several geographical locations. There are private WANs like a company's network. Then there are public WANs like the Internet.

    <h4 class="articleTitle">Leased Lines</h4>
    <p class="generalText">
        Large enterprises will have offices in several geographical locations. They need a way to connect those offices together to the company network. One of those ways is to use a leased line. A leased line is a private network connection between two locations. The leased line does not traverse the public internet. However, it can also have access to the Internet, but it's not required. Enterprises pay a monthly fee to keep the line up and running. Well, a leased line is typically used by enterprises but residential customers can also use them. The bandwidth on a leased line is symmetric. Symmetric means that the upload and download speeds are the same.  A leased line is a layer one service. It provides the physical foundation to create a network.

    <p class="generalText">
        The reason why leased lines are favorable is because they're reliable. The leased line business has been around for a long time and has matured quite nicely over time. Leased lines come with an SLA contract. A Service-Level Agreement (SLA) is a commitment between a service provider and client. For example, one SLA agreement may specify that the leased line will not go down for more than 6 hours in a year. The SLA will also list the guaranteed speed the leased line will provide. With high reliability comes a high price. Along with a high price, a leased line takes about three months to install.

    <p class="generalText">
        Speeds for a leased line can go up to 10 Gb/s. The most known speed is a T1 line where you can expect 1.544 Mb/s download and upload. Another speed is a T3 line with a speed of 44.736 Mb/s. Other speeds are available out there. T1, T3, and etc. are the names used in the United States. In Europe, they are named differently because they use a higher bandwidth. The T1 equivalent in Europe is an E1 which has a speed of 2.048 Mb/s.

    <h4 class="articleTitle">ISP & IXP</h4>
    <p class="generalText">
        The biggest wide area network out there is the Internet. The Internet connects several people, companies, countries, etc. At its core, the Internet is made up of ISPs and IXPs. Typically, a person connects to the internet through an ISP (Internet Service Provider). For example, a person might get their internet from CenturyLink. If someone has CenturyLink then their connected to the CenturyLink network. Then how does someone connect to somebody else in the Xfinity network? Several ISPs like CenturyLink and Xfinity come together and exchange Internet traffic at an IXP (Internet Exchange Point). An IXP is a physical location where ISPs and CDNs connect with each other. While connected at an IXP, ISPs can exchange data outside their own network. That's how someone on the Xfinity network can connect to another person on a CenturyLink network.

    <p class="generalText">
        ISPs agree to share their networking infrastructure with each other through a Peering Agreement. A Peering Agreement is an agreement to exchange networking traffic without a fee to use each other's network. One ISP can send data over another ISPs network in exchange for letting other ISPs use their network. ISPs used to bill each other, but nobody was making any profit. With the lack of profit, they decided to use a Peering Agreement to make things less complicated. ISPs mainly make money from their customers.

        The Internet encompasses several countries also. Countries are mainly connected to the Internet through undersea Fiber cables. Fiber cables are literally laid across the ocean to connect countries. The cable is covered in layers of protection to keep the Fiber safe from the elements. Giant lasers are used to send light through the Fiber cable so it can send data across the ocean.

    <h4 class="articleTitle">Connecting to the Internet</h4>
    <p class="generalText">
        When it comes to connecting to the Internet, the most common technology used is what's already installed in homes. Most people have telephone lines installed in their home. DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) provides an internet connection through telephone lines. DSL internet is asymmetric meaning that download speeds are higher than upload speeds. Typically, you can expect 8 Mb/s download and 1 Mb/s upload from DSL. There are better DSL technologies like VDSL (very high bitrate DSL) and ADSL2+ that provide higher speeds. With DSL, you have a direct line to the ISP and don't have to share bandwidth like cable internet. The downside is that a DSL signal and speed decreases the farther you get away from the ISP. The DSL limit is 18,000 feet (~5,486 meters), but repeaters can be used to extend the signal. To have a DSL connection you need a DSL-capable device at home (DSL modem) and DSL equipment at the ISP (DSLAM).

        Another common item installed in homes is cable TV. Cable internet uses the coaxial cables used with cable TV. Cable internet also uses asymmetric speeds (download speeds are higher than upload). In general, cable internet speeds are higher than DSL. You can expect about 52 Mb/s download and 5 Mb/s upload. Unlike DSL, cable internet doesn't have a dedicated line to the ISP. Instead, a single trunk cable supplies the bandwidth to a neighborhood. If multiple people are using the internet then it will slow down the speed. To have a cable internet connection you need a cable modem.

    <p class="generalText">
        Satellite Broadband might be the only option you have to connect to the internet. Satellite internet uses satellites in high-orbit. These satellites are geostationary meaning that they stay in one place because they move with Earth's rotation. Satellite internet speeds are good that compete with DSL and cable internet. However, the latency is bad since signals have to travel hundreds of miles. Expect to have a latency of about 500 milliseconds or higher. This high latency isn't good for gaming or streaming. New satellites are being developed to be placed in low-orbit so the latency issue will be lessened.

    <p class="generalText">
        Other options to connect to the Internet include Wireless Broadband and Wireless Cell Phone Internet. Wireless Broadband is where an ISP broadcasts internet through a tower. Then customers have antennas at their house to get internet from the tower. Cell Phone Internet is from your cell phone provider. Things like 3G, 4G, LTE are provided by a cell phone provider through towers.
