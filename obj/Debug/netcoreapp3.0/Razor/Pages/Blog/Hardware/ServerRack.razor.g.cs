They’re used in server rooms or data centers. There are different types of server racks. You can have a 2 post or 4 post server rack. With 2 post, there will be two physical posts to install equipment. They cost less, but support less weight. The most common is 4 post. As implied, they have four physical posts that can support more weight, but cost more.\n    </p>\n\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Hardware/ServerRack/MeshAndGlassServerRack.png\">\n\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Racks can also come open or closed. With an open rack, there will only be the frame. An closed/enclosed rack will be covered in metal. They have doors in front and in back to access the hardware. The doors will be glass or made from a mesh. Enclosed racks have added security because their doors can be locked. \n    </p>\n\n   <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Hardware/ServerRack/WallRack.jpg\">\n\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Lastly, certain racks can be mounted to the wall. It’s important to know, they have to be mounted on wall studs with lag bolts. They can also be reinforced using plywood. This way the wall mounted rack doesn’t fall off when a lot of weight is applied. \n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Standards and Lack Thereof</h4>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Hardware/ServerRack/RackUnit.png\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The most common server rack size is 19’’. The Electronic Industries Association defines the standards of a 19’’ server rack. EIA-310-D is the latest revision of the “standard rack” specification. It most importantly defines the size of Rack Unit. The Rack Unit (RU) is defined as 1.75’’/44.45mm. Each U is composed of three holes on a rack. The height of a rack is defined by its Rack Unit. You’ll see sizes such as 10U, 18U, and even 42U. The height of IT equipment is listed as Rack Units such as 1U or 2U. This helps in determining how much space is taken up by equipment.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        EIA-310 also defines the vertical/horizontal hole spacing, rack opening, and front panel width. Even with these dimensions, some hardware might not fit even if they follow EIA standards. The reason is that EIA-310 doesn’t define all the dimensions. For example, rack mounting depth isn’t defined. There are cases where IT equipment is too long and cabinet doors won’t fully close. Another issue is not defining the hole type. You can have square holes, threaded round holes, or unthreaded round holes. \n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Mounting Tips</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Here are some quick mounting tips. Make sure you have enough U space in your rack. Check the minimum and maximum mounting depth. Check how much it weighs since 2 post racks can’t support a lot of weight and the equipment might need rails installed. Put the heaviest equipment on the bottom. You don’t want to make the rack top heavy and have a chance of tipping over. Install the rack in the center of the building so it’s not exposed to windows and keep it locked away from people. \n    </p>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Hardware/ServerRack/CageAndClipNut.png\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        When mounting hardware, it helpful to have the right screws and clips. Most commonly you’ll have square holes which need cage nuts. Cage nuts are square pieces of metal with a threaded hole. They can be clipped into a square hole. The threaded hole in the cage nut is for a screw. This threaded hole supports 10-32, 12-24, M5 or M6 screws. Match the cage nut to its correct screw . You’ll eventually notice that inserting and removing cage nuts aren’t pleasant to the fingers. A screwdriver or cage nut tool can help insert/remove cage nuts.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        If your rack doesn’t have square holes then it will have round holes. Round holes can be threaded or unthreaded. Unthreaded holes will need a clip nut so screws can be used. Threaded holes just need screws. Again, check which type of screw you need. They can be 10-32, 12-24, M5, or M6 type screws.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        If you’re using an electric screwdriver for the screws, set the torque to low. High torque can cause the screws to strip. Torque is how much force a drill produces to turn an object. Stripping screws means to damage the head which will make removing the screw difficult. Also, install screws diagonally. Meaning screw in the top left then bottom right/top right then bottom left. This way the weight is distributed when mounting.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Accessories</h4>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Hardware/ServerRack/RailKit.png\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        There are additional accessories you can buy for your server rack. You can buy rail kits for your hardware to make it easier to slide out. These rails are needed for heavy equipment so they don’t droop down. They can also be used for equipment that is often taken out for maintenance.\n    </p>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Hardware/ServerRack/RackAndDrawer.png\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Shelves and drawers can also be bought. If a piece of hardware can’t be mounted properly then they could be left on a shelf in the rack. Drawers are convenient to store any tools or other equipment for the server room.\n    </p>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Hardware/ServerRack/CableManagementRack.jpg\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Cable management accessories can be really useful. You can get hooks/D-ring, ducts/conduits, and panels to help you manage cables. \n    </p>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Hardware/ServerRack/PDU.png\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Power Distribution Units (PDU) are power strips that can be mounted on server racks. They help deliver power to your IT equipment. \n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        There are also server racks designed for harsh environments. These racks can be reinforced or have a water tight outer shell. If you’re in harsh environment then look into these options. \n    </p>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Hardware/ServerRack/CasterLevelingFeet.jpg\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Racks can be bolted down to the floor or use casters (wheels). With casters you also get leveling feet. “Filler panels” are blank panels used for covering up spots of the rack that aren’t in use. They’re mainly used as aesthetics. Server bezels are covers for equipment. They can be used as added security to cover the front or back so people can’t easily access them. Again, server bezels can server as aesthetics. \n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">References</h4>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        “Define: Cagenut?” <em>The Server Rack FAQ RSS</em>, 10 Oct. 2007, www.server-racks.com/what-is-a-cagenut.html.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        “Define: EIA-310.” <em>The Server Rack FAQ RSS</em>, 11 Oct. 2007, www.server-racks.com/eia-310.html.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        “Define: Rack Hole Types.” <em>The Server Rack FAQ RSS</em>, 14 Oct. 2007, www.server-racks.com/rack-hole-types.html.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Morris, Destiny. “Beginners Guide to Server Racks.” <em>RackSolutions</em>, RackSolutions, 19 Dec. 2018, www.racksolutions.com/news/data-center-optimization/what-is-a-server-rack/.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Morris. “What Is a Server Rack?” <em>RackSolutions</em>, RackSolutions, 12 Nov. 2018, www.racksolutions.com/news/blog/what-is-a-server-rack-2/.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        “Racks.” <em>RackSolutions</em>, RackSolutions, 1 Feb. 2019, www.racksolutions.com/server-racks.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        StarTech.com Support. “Before You Buy - Server Rack Accessories | StarTech.” <em>YouTube</em>, 21 Nov. 2016, youtu.be/Yl720DRqwcQ.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        StarTech.com Support. “Before You Buy - Server Racks | StarTech.” <em>YouTube</em>, 21 Nov. 2016, youtu.be/OPnBVScbh9Q.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        StarTech.com Support. “How to Install - Server Rack Accessories | StarTech.com.” <em>YouTube</em>, 21 Nov. 2016, youtu.be/HfRcN--Y21E.\n    </p>\n\n    <br>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<br>");
