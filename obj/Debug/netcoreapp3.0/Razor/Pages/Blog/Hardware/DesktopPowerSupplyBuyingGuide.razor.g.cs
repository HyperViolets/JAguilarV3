The power supply connects to every component in the PC. It is also the most likely component to fail. Once it starts failing it will damaging everything connected to it. The damage is caused by sending the wrong amount of volts to the hardware. That\'s why you don\'t go cheap on a power supply. Also, buy a power supply from a reputable manufacturer. Reputable manufacturers will have higher quality products and have the certifications for a good power supply.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Safety certifications are a good indication for a well-built power supply. In the United States, the most well-known agency for safety certifications in power supplies is Underwriters Labotaries Inc. (UL). For Canadians, look for the Canadian Standards Agency (CSA) certification. Other certifications in Europe are TUV Rheinland, VDE, and NEMKO. International power supplies should have at least UL, CSA, and TUV certifications.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        A Federal Communications Commission (FCC) safety certification exists, but should be taken lightly. The FCC doesn\'t certify individual power supplies. They certify the motherboard, case, and power supply in a group. The FCC certification only comes in handy if you also buy the motherboard, and case the power supply was tested with.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        If you\'re planning on using more than one graphics card, look into SLI or CrossFire supported power supplies. For NVIDIA, look for certified SLI-Ready power supplies. For AMD, look for CrossFire certified power supplies. Also, look for the SLI-Ready or CrossFire logo on the power supply.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The watt supply decays over time with power supplies. Combined with how the power supply is the most common component to fail, replacement comes into play. You should replace your power supply about every three years.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">80 PLUS</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The 80 PLUS program was created to make a more energy efficient power supply. To be 80 PLUS certified, your power supply must be at least 80% efficient under a 20%, 50%, and a 100% load. The test measures how much usable energy is left after the AC to DC conversion process. For example, at 80% efficiency, 80% of the electricity will usable after the AC to DC conversion. The other 20% will be wasted and turned into heat. So far, there are six level of certifications. From least efficient to most efficient they are: 80 PLUS, 80 PLUS BRONZE, 80 PLUS SILVER, 80 PLUS GOLD, 80 PLUS PLATINUM, and 80 PLUS TITANIUM. Each tier higher is more efficient than its predecessor. I recommend buying at least an 80 PLUS BRONZE power supply. If you want better then 80 PLUS GOLD is the best bang for your buck.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Watts</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        To buy a power supply, you will need to calculate the number of watts you need. Don\'t buy a power supply with the highest watts. You\'ll be wasting watts and money. The easiest way to calculate watts is to use an online Power Supply Calculator. On one of those websites, input the parts you will be using. The online calculator will give you the minimum and/or the recommended number of watts needed. Take the minimum watts and multiply by 1.5 to get the amount of watts you need. We multiply the minimum by 1.5, because it takes into account future upgrades and when a PC part draws more power than normal.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        You can also manually check how many watts a PC component uses and add it up. This is difficult because some PC parts won\'t list the watts used. In that case, find the watts for similar products and make an educated guess. Get all the watts for each individual PC part, add them up, and multiply by 1.5 to get the total watts needed.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        When looking at watts, don’t only look at the peak/maximum amount of watts. The more important number is continuous watts. Continuous watts will be the real performance. The continuous watts might not be listed so look them up in the datasheet for the power supply.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Power Supply Connectors</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Time to talk about how the power supply connects to everything. In modern systems, the most important connector is the ATX 24-pin main power cable. This provides power to the motherboard. The 24-pin cable is an improvement over the ATX 20-pin main power cable. The 24-pin cable provides more power to accommodate for the PCIe slots. The 24-pin and 20-pin  connectors are actually backwards compatible. The ATX 20+4-pin main power cable exists to function in both 20-pin and 24-pin slots. I recommend buying a power supply with 24-pin functionality since they are needed in modern PCs.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The 4-pin peripheral power cable is another common cable. It was even used in the original modern computer. It\'s widely used to power other components in a PC. A few examples are the motherboard, video card, and fans.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The next cable is used to power your CPU. There are three types and they are a 4-pin ATX +12V power cable, 8-pin EPS +12V power cable, and a 4+4-pin +12V power cable. Modern systems use an 8-pin EPS or a 4+4-pin cable for the CPU. You cannot plug a 4-pin ATX cable into an 8-pin slot. However, you can plug an 8-pin EPS or a 4+4-pin into a 4-pin slot. I recommend buying a power supply with an 8-pin EPS or a 4+4-pin cable because they both work with 4-pin and 8-pin slots.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        To power a graphics card, a PCI Express power cable is usually required. If your graphics card doesn\'t use over 75 watts, then it doesn\'t need a power cable. The power from the motherboard can fully support it. However, many graphics cards these days need more power, The most common power cable is a 6+2-pin PCI Express power cable. This is the most popular because it\'s compatible with 6-pin and 8-pin slots. 6-pin cables can slot into an 8-pin slot, but performance of the graphics card will be limited. 8-pin cables can\'t slot into a 6-pin slot. It\'s best to go for a 6+2-pin cable. Also, make sure you have enough 6+2-pin cables to power all your graphics cards.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The last type of connector is a SATA power cable. These will power your SATA hard drives and SSDs. Make sure your power supply has plenty of SATA power cables for your needs. I recommend having at least four SATA power cables.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Modular vs. Non-Modular</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Modularity refers to whether the power cables can be removed from the actual power supply box. Modular power supplies are favored by people who want a cleaner looking computer. There is more resistant for electricity with modular cables. However, the slight resistance is so minor that it doesn\'t matter. Non-modular power supplies have their cables permanently attached to the power supply box. There are also semi-modular power supplies. Only the required cables are permanently attached. Cables like the CPU and motherboard power cables. I recommend buying whatever you want. Keep in mind that modular power supplies will have a higher price tag. It\'s worth the price if you want less wire clutter and a more aesthetic looking PC.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Form Factor</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The most favored form factor by a long shot is ATX12V. ATX12V is an improvement over the ATX form factor. The main difference is that ATX12V cables provide more power. I recommend going with the industry-standard and popularity of ATX12V. Also, make sure your motherboard and case can support ATX12V. If not then look for other compatible form factors or change parts.\n    </p>\n\n    <br>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">References</h4>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Allen, Mark. “All about the Various PC Power Supply Cables and Connectors.” <i>All about the Various PC Power Supply Cables and Connectors</i>, 15 July 2008, www.playtool.com/pages/psuconnectors/connectors.html.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        “How to Choose a Power Supply.” <i>YouTube</i>, 15 Oct. 2014, youtu.be/lXku-gsdyok.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Mueller, Scott. <i>Upgrading and Repairing PCs</i>.
