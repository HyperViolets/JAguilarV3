If you want more info on why I picked my recommendations then continue reading.</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Capacity: The highest capacity you can afford (250GB, 500GB, 1TB, etc.)</li>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Form Factor & Interface: 2.5\'\' SATA III SSD or M.2 NVMe SSD</li>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Flash Memory Component: 3D NAND with MLC</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <br>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Capacity</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        When it comes to the capacity of an SSD, buy the largest SSD you can afford. There are two main reasons for this. SSDs store data in NAND cells. Several NAND cells are combined into blocks. It\'s faster to write data to empty blocks. So, the more empty blocks the better. Larger SSDs will take longer to fill up and in turn have more empty blocks (depending on your usage). It is advised to never use more than 70% of SSD space. If you use more than 70% then performance starts to slow down due to having less empty blocks available. A useful command for SSDs is TRIM. TRIM erases unused blocks so they can be empty.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Another reason to get a larger SSD is to improve lifespan. Larger SSDs will have more blocks to evenly spread out data. This way, one group of blocks won\'t constantly be used. This will increase the lifespan. SSDs have their own algorithms in the controller to evenly distribute data.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Form Factor & Interface</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        There is a difference between form factor and interface. Form factor defines the physical size and shape for computer hardware. M.2 and a 2.5\'\' SSDs are two types of form factors. An interface is a shared boundary between different computer components. Within this context, the interface will mean the boundary between a SSD and the motherboard. For example, SATA III and NVMe are both interfaces. M.2 supports multiple interfaces. For M.2, the most common would be SATA III and NVMe. For a 2.5\'\' SSD drive the most common interface is SATA III.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        I recommend a 2.5\'\' SATA III SSD or a M.2 NVMe. Be aware, the SATA version should be revision 3 (SATA III). SATA III can support speeds up to 600MB/s. Most SSDs these days have a transfer speed of about 550MB/s. SATA revision 2 (SATA II) and SATA revision 1 (SATA I) can\'t support those SSD speeds. Also, check the number of PCIe lanes an NVMe SSD supports. You want an NVMe SSD that supports 4 lanes. Some NVMe SSDs only support two lanes. \n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        2.5\'\' SATA SSDs look like hard drives but smaller. They are designed to be put into an empty drive bay like any other hard drive. Fun Fact: 2.5\'\' SSDs don\'t need all the room within the 2.5\'\' drive. The components of an SSD can easily fit into a much smaller size. That\'s where the smaller form factor of M.2 comes in.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        M.2 is a form factor that looks like a shorter stick of RAM. M.2 slots can be found on most motherboards these days. M.2 was designed for high-performance storage found in devices like laptops and tablets. Eventually, they found their way into motherboards for desktops. The M.2 form factor does come in several sizes. For desktops, the most common size is 2280. Meaning that the M.2 module is 22mm wide by 80mm long. Other common sizes include 2242 and 2260. Usually, longer M.2 modules have more capacity. Including different sizes, M.2 modules can have different keys or notches at the edge where it plugs into the motherboard. A single M.2 module can have one or two keys. Keys are identified by their key ID. For SSDs, the key ID is going to be B or M. Key B supports 2 PCIe lanes. Key M supports 4 PCIe lanes. Key M will allow higher speeds since it has more PCIe lanes. Other keys such as A and E are used for Bluetooth and Wi-Fi adapters. M.2 drives can come with a heatsink. The heatsink helps the drive run at peak performance for longer periods of time. If you\'re constantly writing/reading at high IOPS then it helps out a lot.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Non-Volatile Memory Express or NVMe was designed from the ground up for flash memory. SSDs are a type of flash memory. Thanks to NVMe, the speeds of a SSD are greatly increased. This is due to using PCIe lanes which are connected directly to the CPU. An NVMe SSD is usually 2 or 3 times faster than SATA III. SATA doesn\'t connect directly to the CPU. NVMe does this by using PCIe lanes. PCIe lanes have more bandwidth available to them. Faster speeds come with a hefty price tag. Get ready to pay around double for NVMe SSDs compared to SSDs using SATA III. The faster speeds might seem better, but a regular consumer can\'t take advantage of NVMe. All that extra performance usually isn\'t necessary. Even video editing or intense gaming won\'t fully utilize NVMe. NVMe becomes useful when dealing with big data, databases, data replication and similar activities. The latest version of NVMe is 1.4 which was released June 2019. The previous version is 1.3.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        What about mSATA and ...\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        From my research, a 2.5\'\' SATA III SSD, M.2 SATA III SSD, or a M.2 NVMe SSD are the most common form factors & interface for consumers. Any others are not common or meant for enterprise use. Consumers are people with PCs at home. Enterprise is companies with lots of people and computers/servers.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Flash Memory Component</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        You need to understand the difference between 2D NAND and 3D NAND. 2D NAND or Planar NAND is the traditional way to arrange cells in an SSD. With 2D NAND, there is a single layer of cells. Manufacturers would shrink the cells for more capacity. However, there is a limit on how small the cells can be. The cells got so small that physics started breaking. The cells started to interfere with each other that caused the data to be corrupted or lost.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        To combat the limitations of 2D NAND, 3D NAND became popular. Instead of having one layer, 3D NAND stacks cells vertically in multiple layers. Stacking cells means that you can have a higher capacity. Generally, 3D NAND is cheaper and has better performance. It\'s cheaper because the architecture is easier to build and more data can be inserted onto the SSD. Performance is improved by lowering power consumption, having higher write speeds, and etc. 3D NAND is also called V-NAND (vertical NAND). The most common type of 3D NAND is 64 layer. 3D NAND can have 32, 48, 64, 96 or even 128 layers.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Another part of flash memory is the amount of bits in each cell. Single-level cell (SLC) has one bit in each cell. Multi-level cell (MLC) has two bits in each cell. Triple-level cell (TLC) has three bits in each cell. QLC has four bits in each cell. The more bits in a cell, the more capacity you have. However, having more bits in a cell decreases performance. It results in a slower access time and decreased lifespan. If you\'re looking for the best performance, SLC is the way to go. MLC will be the second best and so on with more bits. I recommend not buying SLC. SLC costs the most with lower capacities. SLC is more suited for an enterprise environment. MLC is the sweet spot for performance and cost. QLC has the cheapest prices and highest capacities, but with the worst performance. For some QLC SSDs, they have SLC cache to speed up performance. However, the SLC cache won\'t help much for transfering large files.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Benchmarks</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The two most common benchmarks you\'ll come across is sequential read/writes and 4K random read/writes. Sequential read/write is the maximum amount of data an SSD can transfer. For sequential read and writes, this isn\'t useful for the average consumer. The sequential is only useful if you\'re constantly moving large files. The more useful benchmark will be random 4K read or write. For 4K, also called 4KB, four kilobytes of data are written or read from random locations on the SSD. This is usually measured in Inputs/Outputs per second (IOPS). The higher the IOPS the better. 4KB random read/writes gives a more real world benchmark. Since SSD usage is usually composed of reading or writing small amounts of data.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Talking about real world performance, the benchmarks shown on websites only gives you a \"good\" idea of the actual performance. Manufacturers will test products in an ideal environment to make them look better. For example, manufacturers will commonly use compressed data to test SSDs. Compressed data writes to an SSD faster compared to incompressible data. Real world data is composed of compressed and incompressible data. Compressed data is data like documents, spreadsheets, PDFs, and etc. Incompressible data is data like music and movies because they\'re already compressed. At the end of the day, performance listed by manufacturers shouldn\'t be fully trusted. Try to do your own testing or testing done by third-parties.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Optane</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Optane is a type of 3D NAND developed by Intel. It has super low latency of about 10 microseconds. It also has much greater endurance for read and writes compared to NVMe drives. Optane drives initially released as a type of cache for hard drives. The cache had an M.2 form factor and were 16 or 32GB in size. Hard drives paired with Optane cache greatly increased the performance. The M.2 cache can\'t be used as storage by itself. Later on, Intel released Optance storage drives that directly connected to a PCIe slot. These Optane drives are about 500GB in max size. When benchmarking, Optane drives perform similar to NVMe drives. Optane also isn\'t cheap. Getting an Optane storage drive only makes sense if you\'re looking for super low latency or need high endurance with great performance like in datacenters.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">References</h4>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Bach, Matt. “SSDs: Advertised vs. Actual Performance.” <i>Puget Systems</i>, 25 Jan. 2013, www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/SSDs-Advertised-vs-Actual-Performance-179/.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Covington, Josh. “NVMe vs. M.2 vs. SATA – What\'s the Difference?” <i>Custom Gaming & Enthusiast PC Blog | Velocity Micro</i>, 5 Dec. 2017, www.velocitymicro.com/blog/nvme-vs-m-2-vs-sata-whats-the-difference/.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Green, Ollie. “SATA 3 vs M.2 vs NVMe - Overview and Comparison.” <i>Online Tech Tips</i>, Online Tech Tips, 20 Aug. 2018, www.online-tech-tips.com/computer-tips/sata-3-vs-m-2-vs-nvme-overview-and-comparison/.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Hansen, Bohs. “Know Your NAND: Storage Types Explained.” <i>ETeknix</i>, Mar. 2016, www.eteknix.com/know-your-nand-storage-types-explained/.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Jacobi, Jon L. “M.2 SSD Roundup: Tiny Drives Deliver Huge Performance.” <i>PCWorld</i>, PCWorld, 17 Sept. 2015, www.pcworld.com/article/2977024/storage/m2-ssd-roundup-tiny-drives-deliver-huge-performance.html.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Kirsch, Nathan. “What Is SATA Express and Why It Matters.” <i>Legit Reviews</i>, 25 Apr. 2014, 10:14 am, www.legitreviews.com/what-is-sata-express-and-why-it-matters_140093.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Lawrence. “Is SSD Speed Related to Its Storage Capacity?” <i>Super User</i>, 2015, superuser.com/questions/957668/is-ssd-speed-related-to-its-storage-capacity.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Lovinus, Adam. “2019 Solid State Drive (SSD) Buying Guide.” <i>Newegg</i>, 6 Dec. 2018, www.neweggbusiness.com/smartbuyer/buying-guides/ssd-buying-guide/.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        “M 2 SSD - Frequently Asked Questions | Kingston.” <i>Kingston Technology Company</i>, 2018, www.kingston.com/us/ssd/system-builder/m2_faq.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Mueller, Scott. <i>Upgrading and Repairing PCs</i>.
