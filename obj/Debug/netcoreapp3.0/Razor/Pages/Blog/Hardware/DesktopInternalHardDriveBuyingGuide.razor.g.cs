If you\'re interested on how I came up with these suggestions then continue reading.</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Form Factor: 3.5 inch drive</li>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">RPM: 7,200 rpm or higher</li>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Capacity: The highest capacity you can afford (500GB, 1TB, 6TB, etc.)</li>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Interface: SATA II or SATA III</li>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Cache: only useful if you constantly read/write small amount of data so don\'t worry too much about it (typically comes in 8MB – 64MB in size)</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <br>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Form Factor</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Form factor is the hardware design which defines the size, shape, and other physical specifications of a component. For a desktop internal hard drives, always get a 3.5 inch hard drive. The 3.5 inch hard drive has become the modern go-to form factor for desktops.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Assuming the rpm, capacity, and every other aspect is the same except for the form factor, larger hard drives will always be faster. The reason is that larger hard drives have larger platters. A hard drive platter is basically a glass or aluminum disk similar to a CD. Your data is stored on these platters. When the platters rotate, the circumference of the platter has a faster linear velocity compared to any point inside the platter. A faster linear velocity means that the hard drive can read and write data faster. The actual physics is outside my field of study so do your own research.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Capacity</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The capacity is how much data can be stored on the hard drive. Since we already determined the form factor is 3.5 inches, the platters are limited in physical size. To have higher capacity, data needs to be crammed in tighter on the platters. This results in a higher areal density. Think of a car that has five passengers. Now, shove five more people into that car. Then shove another five people in the car. That\'s how it is to have different capacities for the same form factor. At the end of the day, a hard drive will perform better with a higher capacity. When the read/write head moves over the platter more data will be passing under the head due to the higher density.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">RPM</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">Revolutions Per Minute or rpm measures how many revolutions the platters make in a minute. A higher RPM will increase the performance of the hard drive. Typically, hard drives have an rpm of 7,200. Cheaper models are going to have less than 7,200 rpm. High-end hard drives will have 10,000 or higher rpm, but they are quite expensive.</p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Interface</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The interface is the type of connection the hard drive has to the board. For desktop internal hard drives, SATA connections are the ones you want. SAS, Fibre Channel, and those other connections are meant for enterprise use and not for personal use. For SATA connections there are three version. SATA I with transfer speeds of 150MB/s. SATA II with speeds of 300MB/s and SATA III with speeds of 600MB/s. Most hard drives can\'t utilize the full transfer speed of SATA I. To be safe, SATA II is all you need. SATA III only comes into play when you\'re dealing with SSDs. SSDs can actually fully utilize the full transfer speed.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Cache</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">The cache is a buffer for a hard drive where data is stored for quicker access. Think of it as RAM for a hard drive. Reading data off the cache is much faster than reading straight from the platters of a hard drive. You might think that more cache will result in a better performing hard drive. One downside of cache is that it doesn\'t come in large quantities. Typically, cache will be 8MB – 64MB in size. That is not a lot of cache to work with. Due to that, cache is reserved for repetitive transfer of small amounts of data. So at the end of the day, having more cache won\'t significantly boost the performance of the hard drive. You\'re better off not focusing on the amount of cache a hard drive has.</p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Media Transfer Rate</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The media transfer rate is the average speed at which the drive can actually read or write data. This is the actual performance of the hard drive. Don\'t confuse this with the interface transfer rate. The interface transfer rate is the amount of data the SATA cable can transfer. Most media transfer rates are around 100MB/s - 150MB/s. This is why the interface transfer rate of SATA II (300MB/s) is plenty to handle the media transfer rate of hard drives. Some websites don\'t even list the media transfer rate. When that happens you have to go to the manufacture\'s website to find the specifications sheet for that specific hard drive. Even with the specifications sheet, finding the average media transfer rate can be difficult.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        There is raw media transfer rate and formatted media transfer rate. The raw media transfer rate is how fast bits can be read and written off the media. However, the raw media transfer rate doesn\'t take into account for the overhead of bits and latency. That\'s where the formatted media transfer rate comes into play. The formatted media transfer rate is the true rate of how fast bits can read and written. It takes into account the overhead and latency in the real world. Here are some tips to find the average formatted media transfer rate. The maximum formatted rate is about ¾ of the maximum raw rate. The minimum transfer rate is ½ of the max transfer rate. The average transfer rate is ¾ of the maximum transfer rate.\n    </p>\n\n    <br>\n</div>\n\n<br>\n<br>");
