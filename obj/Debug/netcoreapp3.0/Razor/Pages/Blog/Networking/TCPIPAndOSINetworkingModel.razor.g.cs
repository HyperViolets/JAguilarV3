This lead to devices from manufacturers not being compatible with each other. Manufacturers would usually use their own proprietary network protocols. In the 1970s, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) set out to create a vendor-neutral networking model. Having a standardized network model would be very helpful, because it\'ll reduce complexity and increase competition. Eventually the ISO would develop the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) networking model.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Also during the 1970s, DARPA funded the United States Department of Defense (DoD) to standardize networking. This movement lead to the creation of the TCP/IP networking model. TCP/IP is a networking protocol basically used by all computers in the modern age. It became highly popular because volunteers from places like universities helped develop the technology further. By the end of the 1990s, TCP/IP became the main networking model. It beat all other networking models including the OSI model.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Even though OSI isn\'t used in the real world anymore, it\'s still important to learn it. To be more specific, it\'s important to learn OSI terminology and the layers. That\'s because several vendors still use OSI terminology. They thought the OSI model would become the dominant networking model and never really stopped using it. At an overview, the TCP/IP and OSI models are very similar. The actual differences show up when they are implemented in the hardware and software.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">The Seven Layers Of The OSI Model</h4>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Networking/TCPIPAndOSINetworkingModel/OSIModel.png\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The seven layers of the OSI model are Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. The best way to remember the layers is to use a mnemonic devices such as: Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away. You can lookup others or create your own, but not throwing sausage pizza away is how I learned it.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">The <strike>Four</strike> Five Layers Of The TCP/IP Networking Model</h4>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Networking/TCPIPAndOSINetworkingModel/TCPIPModel.png\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The TCP/IP model originally had four layers, but was later revised to include the Data Link and Physical layers. As you can see, the OSI and TCP/IP models have very similar layers. The difference is that the TCP/IP model combines the top three layers of the OSI model into an Application layer. It\'s called the TCP/IP model because TCP and IP are both protocols most commonly used with networking.\n    </p>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Networking/TCPIPAndOSINetworkingModel/TCPIPRevision.png\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Learning the OSI and TCP/IP models can help you troubleshoot network issues. Usually troubleshooting starts from the bottom up because the layers are dependent on the layer below them. For example, if you run into an issue you first check if all the cables are plugged in and devices are still working (physical layer). From there, you go up the layers to pin-point the issue.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Encapsulation and De-encapsulation</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        To send data over the network, data goes through encapsulation and de-encapsulation. Encapsulation is enclosing data in headers (and sometimes trailers) so data can be transferred from one protocol to another. To send data to another computer, the data is encapsulated and sent over the network. When the receiving computer gets the encapsulated data, it de-encapsulates the data. De-encapsulation is when a computer removes those headers so the data can be read.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        When you want to send data to another computer, encapsulation starts at Layer 2 of the TCP/IP model. Layer 2 is where the source and destination MAC addresses are added to the header. MAC addresses are used to identify the physical device to send it to. After that, the data is sent to Layer 3 where the destination and source IP are added to the header. Next is Layer 4 where headers are added to identify which protocol is used. Protocols include ICMP (ping), TCP, UDP, etc. Finally headers are added to identify ports and Layer 5 protocols. These include HTTP (port 80), HTTPS (port 443), FTP (port 22), and so on. Once that is done, data is send to the receiving computer and it starts de-encapsulating to get to the data.\n    </p>\n\n    <br>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">References</h4>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Frenzel, Lou. “What\'s The Difference Between The OSI Seven-Layer Network Model And TCP/IP?” <i>Electronic Design</i>, 2 Oct. 2013, www.electronicdesign.com/what-s-difference-between/what-s-difference-between-osi-seven-layer-network-model-and-tcpip.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        “Internet Protocol Suite.” <i>Wikipedia</i>, Wikimedia Foundation, 25 Mar. 2019, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Odom, Wendell. <i>CCENT/CCNA ICND1 100-105: Official Cert Guide.</i> Cisco Press, 2016.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        “OSI and TCP/IP Model Overview.” <i>YouTube</i>, 12 Mar. 2018, www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9RL5jD9cTI&list=PL-8vIrL4k_H2pa-f2q6aqfvEp1ebV390d&index=5&t=0s.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        “TCP/IP vs. OSI: What\'s the Difference Between Them?” <i>FS.com</i>, 3 Nov. 2017, community.fs.com/blog/tcpip-vs-osi-whats-the-difference-between-the-two-models.html.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Upravnik. “Ethernet Frame.” <i>Study-CCNA</i>, study-ccna.com/ethernet-frame/.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        “What Is TCP/IP?” <i>YouTube</i>, 21 June 2016, www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpsEaqJV_A0&list=PL-8vIrL4k_H2pa-f2q6aqfvEp1ebV390d&index=1.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Wyllys, R.
