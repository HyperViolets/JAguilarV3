These standards are defined by the IEEE under 802.3. Data is usually sent through a twisted pair cable, fiber optical cable, or wireless. A LAN can be composed of computers, printers, switches, and etc.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Frames</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Ethernet operates on Layer 2 (Data Link) of the TCP/IP and OSI networking model. This means that Ethernet uses frames to transfer data. To create a frame, the user\'s data is encapsulated with a header and trailer.\n    </p>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Networking/EthernetAndTwistedPairCables/EthernetFrame.png\">\n    <ul>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Preamble: Where the frame tells the receiving computer that a frame is starting. Also helps synchronize the bit sequence.</li>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Start Frame Delimiter (SFD): Signifies that the next bit begins the source MAC address.</li>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Destination MAC Address: The intended recipient of the frame.</li>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Source MAC Address: The sender of the frame.</li>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Type: Identifies the protocol being used inside the frame (IPv4 or IPv6).</li>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Data and Pad: Contains the data being sent. Sometimes pad data is inserted to meet the minimum amount of data needed to be present.<ul><li>You can increase the maximum amount of data being sent by using jumbo frames. With jumbo frames you can increase the max to 9000 bytes. Just edit the MTU (maximum transmission unit).</li></ul></li>\n        <li class=\"bulletPointGeneralText\">Frame Check Sequence (FCS): Checksum used to detect data corruption.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Media Access Control (MAC)</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Included in the Ethernet frame is a source and destination MAC address. A Media Access Control (MAC) is a unique address given to a computer. There are no identical addresses in the world. MAC addresses are issued out by the IEEE to manufacturers. A MAC address is composed of a 6 byte long (48 bits) binary number. The total amount of unique MAC addresses is 2^48 which is 281,474,976,710,656 possible MAC addresses. For convenience, the MAC address is represented as a 12-digit hexadecimal number usually separated by dashes or periods. For example, 448A.5B85.D762. The IEEE issues out the first six hex numbers and the manufacturer assigns the other six. MAC addresses are also called a burned-in addresses, because they are sometimes physically burned into the ROM chip on the NIC.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Twisted Pair Cables: Speed</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Those Ethernet frames need a way to go from computer to computer. One way to send data is using copper wires arranged in twisted pairs. Overall, there are eight wires. Those eight wires are separated into four pairs. The two wires in each pair are twisted together and then all the twisted pairs are combined into one Ethernet cable. The twisting reduces EMI (electromagnetic interference). EMI causes crosstalk between wires which causes data corruption. Twisted pairs are also full duplex. Meaning that they can send and receive data at the same time. Unlike half duplex where data can\'t be simultaneously sent and received. The main way to increase speeds in twisted pairs is to have more twists. A CAT 3 and CAT 6 cable is constructed the same, but CAT 6 just has more twists to reduce crosstalk which increases speed.\n    </p>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Networking/EthernetAndTwistedPairCables/CATSpeeds.png\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Twisted pair cables come in several categories of speeds called CAT for short. So far, the most common speed is CAT 5e. CAT 5e is an improvement over CAT 5. CAT 5 and CAT 3 are obsolete cables that shouldn\'t be used. CAT 6 is rated for 10Gb, but only up to 55 meters. You can get 1Gb speeds from CAT 6 at 100 meters. CAT 6a and CAT 7 both require shielding for their cables for better reliability. They\'re the same specifications as CAT 6, but they\'re just more reliable. Reliability is good for places like datacenters where an enterprise company needs it. For reference, 100 meters is as long as a football field.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Twisted Pair Cables: Solid and Stranded</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The copper in twisted pair cables comes in two forms. Those forms are solid and stranded. Solid twisted pair cables have eight solid copper cables. These type of copper cables are good for in-wall wiring, punching-out to a patch panel or punching-down to a keystone. They are rigid and aren\'t meant to be handled constantly. Basically, they\'re meant to be installed in the main networking infrastructure for a building and never touched again.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The other kind, stranded, is good for patch cables. Patch cables are just shorter lengths of twisted pair cables. The copper wires in stranded cables are made up of multiple smaller diameter wires wrapped together. This makes the cables more flexible and last longer under everyday use by a consumer. These are the typical Ethernet cables an everyday user will buy.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        There are specific RJ-45 connectors used for solid and stranded cables. When crimping your own Ethernet cable, use the right RJ-45 connector. Some RJ-45 connectors are made for solid cables and others are made for stranded cables. If you have a solid Ethernet cable then use a solid RJ-45 connector and vice versa.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Twisted Pair Cables: UTP and STP</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Another way to differentiate twisted pair cables is by their shielding or lack of shielding. UTP, Unshielded Twisted Pair, has no shielding. While STP, Shielded Twisted Pair, does have shielding. Shielding helps reduce crosstalk and EMI. Typically, consumers just need UTP since it can get the job done and STP is more expensive.\n    </p>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Networking/EthernetAndTwistedPairCables/UTPSTP.png\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Manufacturers represent shielded and unshielded cables in the \"x/xTP\" format. As you can see from the list above there are several types. \"S\" stands for braided shielding and is only used on the outer layer. \"F\" stands for foil where the cable or twisted pairs are wrapped in foil. \"U\" means that no shielding is used. \"TP\" stands for twisted pair.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Twisted Pair Cables: Wire Gauge</h4>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Networking/EthernetAndTwistedPairCables/WireGauge.jpg\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        Wire gauge is used to measure a wire\'s diameter. The lower the gauge number then the larger the wire diameter. Larger diameter wires will mean less electrical resistance. Longer cables will typically have a larger diameter. Smaller diameter cables means that the cable can be smaller/thinner. From the image above you can see the difference in wire gauges. One wire is 24 gauge while the other is 28 gauge. The 28 gauge wire is thinner compared to the 24 gauge.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Twisted Pair Cables: Crimping Your Own</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        You can crimp your own Ethernet cables. Meaning that you can attach an RJ-45 connector to the end of an Ethernet cable. All you need is the proper tools and the knowledge on how to arrange the wires. You\'ll need an RJ-45 crimp tool, a way to cut the sleeves and wires, an RJ-45 connector, and an Ethernet cable. Be aware that RJ-45 connectors come in two types. One type is for solid Ethernet cables and the other is for stranded Ethernet cables. If you have a stranded Ethernet cable then use a stranded RJ-45 connector and vice versa\n    </p>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Networking/EthernetAndTwistedPairCables/T568A.png\">\n    <br>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Networking/EthernetAndTwistedPairCables/T568B.png\">\n    <br>\n    <img class=\"articleImage\" src=\"/images/Blog/Networking/EthernetAndTwistedPairCables/CrossoverWireScheme.png\">\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        There are two ways to arrange the wires for an Ethernet cable. You can create a straight through or crossover cable. The most common cable is straight through. Straight though cables are used to connect \"unlike\" devices. For example, use a straight through cable if you want to connect a computer to a switch. Crossover cables are used to connect \"like\" devices such as connecting a switch to a switch. Sometimes there is software used in devices to detect if you\'re using the wrong type of cable and corrects it.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        The wires in a straight through cable can be also be arranged in two different ways. Those are the T568A and T568B wiring schemes. T568B has become the de facto standard, but both get the job done.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        To start crimping, cut the sleeve off one end of the cable to expose the wires. Untwist the wires and arrange then in one of the wire schemes above. Make sure the RJ-45 connector is oriented correctly (clip down). Insert the wires into the RJ-45 connector. Part of the sleeve needs to be inserted into the RJ-45 connector to make sure the RJ-45 connector doesn\'t slip out. Finally insert the RJ-45 connector with the wires into the crimping tool and press down.\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">Twisted Pair Cables: Misc.</h4>\n    <p class=\"generalText\">\n        If you\'re an average consumer then a stranded U/UTP straight through cable will do you just fine. In fact, this is the type of cable most commonly sold in stores. However, if you\'re in the business of laying Ethernet cable down then look at your needs. Is there a lot of EMI in the area where shielding is necessary? Is the cable going to be outside and exposed? Maybe you need to meet specific building codes. Some Ethernet cables have cable jacket ratings such as CM/CMG, CMP, or CMX. CMX means that the cable can be used outdoors. CMP means that the cable can be used in plenums. Ethernet cables can also have a UL or ETL rating. This means that the cable is safety certified by a Nationally Recognized Testing Labotory (NRTL).\n    </p>\n\n    <h4 class=\"articleTitle\">References</h4>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Beacham, Frank. “How 24 AWG, 26 AWG and 28 AWG Network Cables Differ.” <i>The Broadcast Bridge</i>, 7 May 2018, 12:05 PM, www.thebroadcastbridge.com/content/entry/11045/how-24-awg-26-awg-and-28-awg-network-cables-differ.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        Black Box Corporation. “Stranded vs. Solid Copper Ethernet Cables.” <i>Black Box</i>, 6 Apr. 2019, www.blackbox.com/en-us/resources/black-box-explains/cables/solid-vs-stranded-cable.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"citation\">\n        CableWholesale.com, director.
